# Privacy Policy

First things first, at MLN Dashboard, we take your privacy seriously. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, protect, and share your information.

We will ask you to provide personal information like your name, email, and date of birth, but don't worry, we won't do anything evil with it.
The Personal Information that we collect are used for providing and improving the Service. We will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.
The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions, which is accessible in our website, unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy.

We also use cookies, but you can delete these with your browser.

### Questions

If you have question about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at [TODO: CONTACT EMAIL]

### Visitors

Like most website operators, MLN Dashboard collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. MLN Dashboard's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how MLN Dashboard's visitors use its website. From time to time, MLN Dashboard may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

MLN Dashboard also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. MLN Dashboard does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below. We may also collect and use IP addresses to block users who violated our Terms of Service.

### Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors to MLN Dashboard's websites choose to interact with MLN Dashboard in ways that require MLN Dashboard to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that MLN Dashboard gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. MLN Dashboard collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with MLN Dashboard. MLN Dashboard does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain Service-related activities.

Additionally, some interactions, such as posting a comment, may ask for optional personal information. For instance, when posting a comment, may provide a website that will be displayed along with a user's name when the comment is displayed. Supplying such personal information is completely optional and is only displayed for the benefit and the convenience of the user.

### Aggregated Statistics

MLN Dashboard may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to the Service. For instance, MLN Dashboard may monitor the most popular parts of the [URL]. MLN Dashboard may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, MLN Dashboard does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.

### Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information

MLN Dashboard discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on MLN Dashboard's behalf or to provide services available at MLN Dashboard's websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using the Service, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. MLN Dashboard will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, MLN Dashboard discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when MLN Dashboard believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of MLN Dashboard, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of the Service and have supplied your email address, MLN Dashboard may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with MLN Dashboard and our products. We primarily use our website and blog to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. MLN Dashboard takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

### Cookies

A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and that the visitor's browser provides to the Service each time the visitor returns. MLN Dashboard uses cookies to help MLN Dashboard identify and track visitors, their usage of MLN Dashboard Service, and their Service access preferences. MLN Dashboard visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using MLN Dashboard's websites, with the drawback that certain features of MLN Dashboard's websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.

### Data Storage

MLN Dashboard uses third party vendors and hosting partners to provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and related technology required to run the Service. You understand that although you retain full rights to your data, it may be stored on third party storage and transmitted through third party networks.

### Security

We value your trust in providing us your Personal Information, thus we are striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

### Children's Privacy

This Services do not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal identifiable information from children under 13. In the case we discover that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we immediately delete this from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so that we will be able to do necessary actions.
