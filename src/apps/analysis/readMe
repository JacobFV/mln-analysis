Python Version: 3.7.3

Running the Code:
driverFunction-v5.py path_to_the_MLN_file path_to_the_analysis_Config_file
eg: python driverFunction-v5.py IMDb-5KMovies-ActorFBLikes_DirectorBudget_MovieRating\Layers\mlnFileIMDB_5kMovies-v1.txt IMDb-5KMovies-ActorFBLikes_DirectorBudget_MovieRating\Analysis\analysisConfigFileIMDb_5kMovies-v1.txt

** Change the Path for BASE in IMDb-5KMovies-ActorFBLikes_DirectorBudget_MovieRating\Layers\mlnFileIMDB_5kMovies-v1.txt
** Chnage the Path for OUTPUT_DIR in IMDb-5KMovies-ActorFBLikes_DirectorBudget_MovieRating\Analysis\analysisConfigFileIMDb_5kMovies-v1.txt

The driver function takes two arguments:
    1. MLN file which has inter layer edges, intra layer edges and also MLN Structure.
    2. Analysis Config file contains N number of expressions(Analysis Objectives) to be computed.
		analysis objective includes:
			communityDetectionAlgorithm, weightMetrics, MatchingAlgorithm,LayersToBeComputed
			eg: infomap,we,mwm,ActorFBLikes-DirectorAvgBudget
			(Order is important)
			User can also mention the output directory, where the result of the expression can be stored

            community Detction Algorithm choices:
Infomap, Louvain
Weight metrics choices: for bipartite graph generation
    we = edge weight
    wf = edge fraction
    wd = edge density
    wp = vertices participation
    wh = participating hubs weight
Macthing Algorithm choices:
    mwm (Maximal Weighted Matching)
    mwpm (Maximal Weighted Perfect Matching)
    mwmt (Maximal Weighted Matching with Ties)
    mwrm (Maximal Weighted Relaxed Matching)
    (Please give the abbreviation in the equation)

Folder Structure:
Main Folder MLN Analysis: 
	Contains:
	Driver Function to be run (driverFunction.py)
	finalComponents: Which has the code for all components
	Data FIle:
	eg: DBLP, IMDB-Random-1000, IMDB-Top-500-Actors
Data File Contains two folders:
	Analysis: contains analysisConfigFile.txt
			  Analysis objective result folders
			  Note that, user can also mention different output path for analysis objectives.
	Layers:   contains Inter layer and Intra layers files.
			  community folder: contains community info files for each layer
