Pages are defined in `/pages` directory and written in ReactJS (mostly typescript). I am recommending the following libraries:

- preact: possible lightweight react alternative
- mantine: builds on top of react and provides specific components we will need like

  - `@mantine/dropzone`: uploading files
  - `@mantine/modals`: simple modal dialogs
  - `@mantine/rte`: rich text editor for making research reports with support for formatting, tables, lists, image uploads, video embedding, and mentions of other users
  - `@mantine/hooks`: qt form builder for lgoin, registration, and other forms
  - `Spoiler`: provide short summaries of an author's research
  - `AppShell`: quick app template UI component
  - `Grid`: flexible layout
  - `Autocomplete`: options for application input
  - `SegmentedControl`: options for application output
  - `Breadcrumbs`: file navigation
  - `Stepper`: progress bar for application execution and creating new accounts

- material-ui and mui: developer-friendly, accelerate development time, meet user expectations on both desktop and mobile, different screen sizes, and with accessibility requirements.
- apollo ecosystem: flexible and complex queries with client-side caching.
- Modularized SASS: for flexible styling with jsx/tsx.
