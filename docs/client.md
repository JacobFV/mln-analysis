# Client

Pages are defined in `/pages` directory and written in ReactJS (mostly typescript). I used the material-ui library for user interface design because its components provide a strong starting point to meet user expectations on both desktop and mobile, different screen sizes, and with accessibility requirements.

I used the axios library to make HTTP requests to the server since it handles errors and building json objects from the response data for the client.
