# Client

Pages are defined in `/pages` directory and written in ReactJS (mostly typescript). I am recommending the following libraries:

- material-ui and mui: developer-friendly, accelerate development time, meet user expectations on both desktop and mobile, different screen sizes, and with accessibility requirements.
- apollo ecosystem: flexible and complex queries with client-side caching.
- Modularized SASS: for flexible styling with jsx/tsx.
